# World Weather Analysis

## Overview

This analysis project was performed to practice using Python to connect to APIs  to extract location and weather data. We created random coordinates and the used the OpenWeather API to find and extract current weather conditions in the locations for our coordinates.  We also used the Google Places API to find hotels near the locations created and also the Google Directions API to map routes between locations, and plot maps showing hotel locations and a travel itinerary between location, showing current weather conditions.
